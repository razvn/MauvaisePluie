### Versions
v1.0b10
- keep already playing sound and add sound games on the top
- add animations on the iPad version too
- bigger buttons (and even bigger on the iPad)
- stretch UI to be able enter scores on the 4" iPhone

v1.0b6
- new version in SpriteKit. This is how this kind of game is supposed to be done, so I wanted to also do a version in the right way
- new font and coherence in all views
- NSTimer version is back, it's a demo project so it should be there. Maybe I'll make some updates to it if I have free times to make it better
- UI turned to english
- More levels added
- Move buttons a bit larger as the other buttons in the UI that where sometime hard to tap on
